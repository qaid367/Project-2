            <h1>Why Soccer is My Favorite Sport</h1>
            <p>
              Soccer has always been my favorite sport. There's just something
              about the excitement of the game that gets me every time. Whether
              it's a close match where every pass matters or a last-minute goal
              that makes the crowd go wild, soccer never fails to keep me on the
              edge of my seat.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons I love soccer is because it's so simple.
              All you need is a ball and some space to play. When I was younger,
              I used to play in the backyard for hours, pretending I was playing
              in the World Cup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soccer is also a sport that connects people. No matter where
              you're from, you can talk to someone about soccer and instantly
              share something in common. It's a sport that's played all over the
              world, and I think that's pretty cool. Watching soccer also makes
              me feel like I'm part of something bigger, whether it's cheering
              for my favorite team or just enjoying the game with friends.

                Zinedine Zidane's headbutt in the 2006 World Cup final got him
                sent off, leaving France with only 10 players. Because of this,
                France lost their star player during a crucial moment.
